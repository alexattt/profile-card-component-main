# Frontend Mentor challenge - Profile card component

<p>My version of profile card component for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is responsive. Added some extra animation. :)</p>
